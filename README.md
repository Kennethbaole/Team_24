The ohanaCM directory contains the main.css style that closely imitates the mockup. The index html is the home page which has a "Sign In" and "Create Account". Universally there is a "Home" button at the top right of each html page. Login.html is where the sign in is. It has "Username" and "Password" and a link to the create-account.html via the "Sign Up" button. Create-account.html has 5 entries: First Name, Last Name, Username, Email, and Password. The Email entry requires an "@" symbol in order to qualify to create account. The contacts.html has the search feature near the top right of the page. Creating a contact opens a windows with the opportunity to enter a First Name, Last Name, Address, Email, Phone, and Image (Profile Photo). The Pencil stencil to the left of a contact is the Edit button which allows the Contact to be edited with an Update Button or be deleted via the Delete Button.
